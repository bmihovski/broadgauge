Hello everyone,

This year, Python Month is back in all its glory, but with a new face and a new plan. Python Month is now Python Express! There were two main motivations behind this idea.

One is the tremendous response that we got last year both in terms of trainers willing to teach, as well as colleges and institutions willing to organize workshops. Both these factors made us think, "Why stop with just one month?". Hence, Python Express is going to be an ongoing effort.

The second motivation was the lessons learned from organizing such an initiative without the proper use of technology. A lot of time was spent in match making and house keeping the records related to all the workshops. After having understood what would save everyone's time when automated, we've built this brand new website for Python Express!

What should you do?
-------------------

Sign up as a trainer on the Python Express website and check the list of up coming workshops from Workshops tab. If you find any of them are suitable for you and you want to take it, you can select them by workshop name and confirm it from Express Interest button. Once you are accepted, you will be notified and things can be taken forward from there.

You can set up a new workshop from your organization space which can be found into Organization tab. The trainers who have already signed up will be able to see all of the upcoming workshops which belong to your institution. If they are interested, they can apply as a trainers. Once that happens, you will be able to accept them and take it forward.
